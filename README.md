# Explore Azure Databricks
Azure Database is a cloud-based data analytics platform that provides a unified environment for dataengineering, Machine Learning and analytics. It is built on top of Apache Spark which is a powerful, ope source processing engine built around speed, ease of use and sophisticated analytics. 

It enables:
data preparation
machine learning
data science workflows

# Understand key concepts

1) Workspace: an environment for accessing all the databricks assets. It provides a user interface to manage notebooks, libraries and experiments. Workspaces are organised into folders and shared among team members facilitating collaboration and resource management.

2) Notebooks: Databricks notebooks are interactive documents that contain runnable code, visualization aand narrative text.
3) Clusters: These are computational engines of Azure databricks, users can create and scale clusters according to the computational resources.
4) Jobs: are used to schedule and run automated tasks. These tasks can be notebook run, spark jobs or arbitrary code executions.
5) Databrick Runtime: This is a set of optimized version of Apache Spark. It includes enhancements for improved performance.
6) Delta lake: This is an open source storage layer that brings reliability and scalability to data lakes. It provides ACID Transactions, scalable metadata handling and unifies streamings and batch data processing.
7) Databricks SQL: Provides a way to perform SQL with Azure databricks.
8) ML flow: is an open-source plaform for managing end-to-end ML lifecycle. It includes features for experiment tracking, model management and deployment, helping practitioners manage and share their ML modes and experiments efficiently.
